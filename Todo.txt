These are in no particular order


1. Collectible.cs - Add System to store pickups. Also they had downward velocity
scaling with score, should change that at some point. Also unsure on rotation, but
its fine for now. 

2. EnemySpawner.cs - Also based on score, I'd rather it be based on time, so disabling
for now. Should also subscribe to OnGameOver for flow control. Lives is also currently
in PlayerHealth.cs, this should be fixable with Events. I honestly think the entire spawner 
Script needs to be redone as well.

3. Enemy.cs - I think there will be multiple enemy types, and also speed based on time, health based on time

4. CollectibleSpawner.cs needs overhaul when pickup system is created

5. PlayerController.cs complete overhaul needed for when new shooting system is implemented. Temp fix with GetScore

6. MovingState.cs need to readdress moving since this is a locked horizontal movement game.
